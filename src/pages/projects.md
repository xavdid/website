I've spent a lot of time over the years writing on code. Sometimes for money, other times for fun. Some projects get formal releases and versions, many more don't.

## Greatest Hits

- [reddit-user-to-sqlite](https://github.com/xavdid/reddit-user-to-sqlite), a CLI tool for archiving data about a Reddit user. Made as part of the [2023 Reddit API Controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Reddit_API_controversy). I wrote [a blog post about it](/blog/post/archive-your-reddit-data/), and it was [covered by Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-download-your-reddit-data/).
- My [Advent of Code solutions](https://github.com/xavdid/adventofcode) (and accompanying [solution writeups](https://advent-of-code.xavd.id/)) for the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles ([more info](http://localhost:1234/blog/post/building-aoc-showcase/))
- [Universal Test Runner](https://github.com/xavdid/universal-test-runner), for running the unit tests in any repo. Adapted into the [Exercism](https://exercism.org) [CLI's](https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises/working-locally) `test` command ([PR](https://github.com/exercism/cli/pull/1092)). This is my current favorite project; I [blogged about it](http://localhost:1234/blog/post/run-every-test/)!
- [Typed Install](https://github.com/xavdid/typed-install), a CLI utility to smartly install type definitions when installing JS packages.
- [Heroku Config](https://github.com/xavdid/heroku-config), a Heroku plugin for managing project for your environment.
- [epub-wordcount](https://github.com/xavdid/epub-wordcount), a CLI tool for easily estimating the words in an `epub` file.
- [Seymour](https://github.com/xavdid/seymour), a custom feed reader for Slack.
- [Drafts JS Editor](https://davidbrownman.com/drafts), a web editor for writing [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) workflows while taking advantage of Typescript auto-complete. This project, and subsequent collaboration with Drafts' creator [Greg Pierce](https://twitter.com/agiletortoise), led to a new [scripting documentation site](https://scripting.getdrafts.com/).
- [This Website](https://github.com/xavdid/xavdid.github.io/)! It's the third major version of my personal site, this time using React.js and Gatsby. <!-- I wrote more about the latest version here -->

### Via a Job

- While at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), all of my public open source contributions are available under the [xavdid-stripe](https://github.com/xavdid-stripe) GitHub user. So far, I've made contributions to the Stripe Dashboard, Stripe CLI, and influenced the design of the Stripe SDKs (especially Node.js and Python).
- While at [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), I was a primary maintainer of the [Zapier Platform](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform), consisting of a CLI, SDK, and JSON Schema. I triaged issues, performed important refactors, and focused on performance optimizations.
- While at [RelateIQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SalesforceIQ), I wrote the [RelateIQ Ruby SDK](https://github.com/xavdid/ruby-sdk). This was during the height of my ruby days while working at RelateIQ, this was a fully tested and documented UX-focused wrapper for reading and writing from their API.

### Closed Source

These projects aren't available publicly, so you'll just have to take my word for it that they were really cool.

- At Stripe, I work primarily on the Stripe Dashboard and some of our backend tooling. You've likely seen my work if you've tried to change a setting while in Test Mode.
- At Zapier, my first big project on the platform team was to re-write the Slack integration to take advantage of their new webhook features. If you used Slack with Zapier anytime after May 2017, you were using my code!
- I also implemented a version of the public Zapier Developer page. You can see a (mostly working) version of it at the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20180326060057if_/https://zapier.com/developer/)
- At RelateIQ, my primary job was "Internal Tools". The best one was a internal admin site built with Sinatra that read from our production Mongo database.

## B-Sides

<!-- - [Kerfuffle](https://kerfuffle.herokuapp.com/), a custom web UI to help me randomly pick a show/book/movie. It's gone through a few major iterations and technology changes. Version 1 used Angular 1! -->

- [Will it Play?](https://github.com/xavdid/will-it-play), a CLI tool for checking if a video file is likely to play on a PS4 (and PS5).
- [JSON Requests](https://github.com/xavdid/json-requests), an extremely barebones HTTP request library for Typescript.
- [generator-xavdid](https://github.com/xavdid/generator-xavdid), a [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) generator for creating Typescript projects. Works for CLIs, frontend, backend, or any combination thereof!
- [Airtable Grouped Chart](https://github.com/xavdid/airtable-grouped-chart), my award winning (I can't find a link anywhere, but I got a bunch of Airtable credit for this!) custom block for building charts based on grouped properties.
- [refbook](https://github.com/xavdid/refbook), a website that provided automated testing and user registration for the now-defunct International Referee Development Program of ~~quidditch~~ quadball. This was my first large-scale solo project and provided an invaluable start to my career in web development. It was hosted at `refdevelopment.com`
- [serenity.forsale](https://serenity-for-sale.netlify.app/), a Gatsby site to sell our converted campervan. The site's source is [on GitHub](https://github.com/xavdid/serenity-for-sale).
- [Monkey TS](https://github.com/xavdid/monkey-ts), an implementation of the Monkey programming language written in Typescript. See also: _[Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)_.
- [Publists](https://github.com/xavdid/publists), a project I wrote during my 2016 funemployment to easily share [Wunderlists](https://www.wunderlist.com/) (RIP) publicly.
- [Pitch Awesome](https://github.com/xavdid/pitch_awesome) was my one and only iOS app based on an idea given to me by my (then) girlfriend. It was a simple pitch pipe that could store a set of opening notes for songs. It's still on my phone to this day!
<!-- - [Stack Pro](https://stackpro.herokuapp.com/), a little webapp I wrote as part of a job app for a now-defunct contracting outfit. Notable because as of time of writing, I believe this holds the record for longest-running code without modification. It's not complex, but it's been operating flawlessly since 2015. -->
- [Monopoly Tracker](https://davidbrownman.com/monopoly/), a static site that lets users track which Safeway Monopoly tickets they've picked up. Spoiler: you never win.
- [Band Groups](https://github.com/xavdid/bgroups), a simple static page I wrote for a friend to easily sort a large list of students into groups.
- [Dead Simple](https://github.com/xavdid/dead_simple), a proof of concept for a totally ephemeral, anonymous chat with web sockets.
- [Countdown](https://github.com/xavdid/countdown), a site that shows factoids to help you visualize how far away a date is. Mostly defunct now (since the event we were counting down to has passed), but some pretty cute code.
- [LoL API](https://github.com/xavdid/lolapi), the first major project I worked on. I was hoping to develop a data API for League of Legends data (before [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/en) released [theirs](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#data-dragon). I had a mini CLI that could simulate two characters fighting (on a super simple level).
- I wrote a [simple python script](https://gist.github.com/xavdid/d07ef908fe023f2e1225) on a plane to let a pair of people play [Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe).

## Notable Open-Source Contributions, PRs and Issues

There's an exhaustive list of my contributions using [this GitHub search](https://github.com/issues?q=author%3Axavdid+archived%3Afalse+-user%3Axavdid+-user%3Aquidtech+) (must be logged in), but here are the coolest ones:

### PRs

- Added the `isSpinning` property to `ora` ([sindresorhus/ora#73](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ora/pull/73))
- Added `files` property to the `mercury-parser` package, to reduce the size of the shipped code ([postlight/mercury-parser#269](https://github.com/postlight/mercury-parser/pull/269))
