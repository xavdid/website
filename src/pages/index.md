# Welcome to my corner of the World Wide Web

I'm a software engineer by trade and I've created this site as a one-stop shop for information pertaining to my personal and professional lives. Apparently they let anyone put websites online these days, so welcome to mine.

### My life right now

I'm a Senior Engineer on the Sandboxes team at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and work remotely from my home in San Mateo, CA.

### My experience

If you're interested in a curated list of my best projects, [look no further](/projects). You can also check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/xavdid), which is all of the public code I've ever written.

My main technical expertise is in the `Python` and `Typescript` ecosystems (especially for full stack web development). I've contributed to the largest `Ruby` codebase in the world and have made some notable open source `Go` contributions.

My primary interest areas are superb developer experiences (especially via the `CLI`) and crafting web APIs, but I've also enjoyed working with `React.js`. Mostly, I enjoy doing new things. I have a proven track record of engineering leadership, mentorship, and technical planning + execution.

For my formal work history, check out [my resume](/resume).

### Advent of Code

Since 2020, I've written solutions to all of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). They've got their own showcase here: https://advent-of-code.xavd.id/

### david.reviews

I maintain a comprehensive list of everything I play, read, and watch. Partly to source info for my [yearly media awards blog post](/blog/tags/yearly-review), but also just because it's fun.

You can see what I'm currently enjoying on the homepage of [david.reviews](https://david.reviews/). There's also reviews for each category and (on Airtable) my ever-growing "To X" lists:
