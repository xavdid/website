# Welcome to my corner of the World Wide Web

I'm a software engineer by trade and I've created this site as a one-stop shop for information pertaining to my personal and professional lives. Apparently they let anyone put websites online these days, so welcome to mine.

### My life right now

I'm a Senior Engineer on the Sandboxes team at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and work remotely from my home in San Mateo, CA.

### My experience

If you're interested in a curated list of my best projects, [look no further](/projects). You can also check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/xavdid), which is all of the public code I've ever written.

My main technical expertise is in the `Typescript` / `Javascript` / `Node.js` ecosystem (full stack), but I also write a lot of `Python` & `Django`. Once upon a time, I wrote a lot of `Ruby`. My primary interest areas are superb developer experiences (especially via the `CLI`) and crafting web APIs, but I've also enjoyed working with `React.js`; I mostly enjoy doing new things. I have a proven track record of engineering leadership, mentorship, and technical planning + execution.

For my formal work history, check out [my resume](/resume).

### My media lists

I maintain a comprehensive list of everything I play, read, and watch. Partly to source info for my [yearly media awards blog post](/blog/tags/lookback), but also just because it's fun. Each follows my [4-point media rating system](/blog/post/on-the-rating-of-media/). Check them out:
