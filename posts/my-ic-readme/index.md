Hello! I'm David, and I'm excited to work with you. This document is meant to help you get up to speed with how I work as an Individual Contributor. This document _is not_ a binding contract; it's self-reported guidelines to my working life. It is [updated periodically](https://github.com/xavdid/website/commits/source/posts/my-ic-readme/index.md). The structure of the document is inspired by [Amy Nguyen's _"Working with me"_](https://amy.dev/?p=979) and the other READMEs I read internally while at Zapier.

## About Me

- I've been working at tech companies since I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2014.
- I live in the Bay Area with my wife, Vicky.
- I make friends quickly and rarely hold grudges.
- I go by David, never Dave, Davy, etc. "Brownman" is ok if we're like, on a sports team.
- I'm not on many sports teams.

## What Drives Me

This section is the "why". Jump to [How I Work](#how-i-work) for some of the "how".

### Helping

My biggest motivation comes from knowing I have helped someone.

In a product org, this typically means talking with the beneficiaries of whatever it is I help make. That could be our company's end-users, internal stakeholders, or strangers who rely on my open source packages. This isn't a strict requirement for my job, but I'm most gratified (and as a result, motivated) when I know how others have benefited from my work. At Zapier, I made a point to hear from our [developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs) via help tickets, [GitHub issues](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/issues?q=mentions%3Axavdid+), and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A1825390+%5Bzapier%5D).

For managers, pointing me towards examples where I've had direct, beneficial impact on coworkers can help energize me out of a slump. For coworkers, an occasional DM letting me know that I helped you never fails to make my day.

### Learning

I am the very definition of a "lifelong learner"; I love to learn about the world just for the sake of it. Sometimes, this is even useful for work purposes!

I learn best by _doing_. Being able to try it out for myself will yield much better results than attending a lecture or watching a video. When I read technical books, I'll catalogue new info in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), the app that most closely mirrors [how my brain works](/blog/post/how-i-obsidian/).

### Teaching

I am energized by teaching, especially if I help someone understand something new.

Sometimes, this is direct action (like answering [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1825390/xavdid) questions, pairing, or mentoring; see below). Other times, it's educational documents/guides that I throw into the ether, like my [Advent of Code tutorials](https://advent-of-code.xavd.id/) (which I'm very proud of). Answering questions in Slack is basically tiny teaching, so that's why I enjoy it so much.

### Exploring Technical Interests

I don't usually get to work on projects relating to the topics in this list. When I do, it's a fun bonus! In no particular order:

- Dynamically generating/transforming code
- Creating CLI tools
- Learning a new technology or programming language
- Type systems
- Organizing and cataloguing data (especially with [Airtable](https://airtable.com/))

### Demotivating Factors

- My work doesn't seem to matter to the company
- My work or isn't recognized by our users or my peers
- Meetings are the only way our team can effectively communicate

## How I Work

This section is the "how". Jump to [What Drives Me](#what-drives-me) for the "why".

### Task Management

- I do my most effective project work when I have a long backlog of tasks I can work through at my own pace.
- If I don't have something assigned, I'll find something to do.
  - This will likely be a minor bug that I've been meaning to fix.
  - My doing this _could_ be considered a "feature"; I can fix a lot of things this way.
  - If you'd rather I not do this, help me make sure I always have a "next thing" to work on.
  - To that end, having clear short- and long-term team priorities is helpful for me.
- I'm great at setting task and follow-up reminders in Slack and [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/), my todo [app of choice](/blog/post/my-perfect-task-app/). If I don't write it down, I will probably forget about it.
- I'm decent at breaking down complex tasks into Jira tickets. I'm improving on giving each sub-ticket enough info to stand on its own.

### Slack

- My Slack status is almost always descriptive and up-to-date. Reading it will help you know when I'll reply to your message, be it: soon, later, tomorrow, next week, or eventually.
- Slack is almost always open on my computer and I check it frequently during my work hours.
- I'm a Slack completionist: I read 100% of the new messages in each channel I'm in. You can `@ mention` if I should see a message _now_, but don't need to if it's not time-sensitive and in a channel I'm already in.
- Stripes: I have a work phone, but only carry it when I'm on-call or at an onsite. Personal email / phone is the only way to reach out of work hours (and only in emergencies, please).

### Hours

- I usually work in US Pacific time.
- I'll be awake by 9:30am and online by 10am. I'll start lunch between noon and 1pm (depending on my meeting schedule).
- Try as I might, I'm just not a morning person.
- My best focus time is pre-lunch or late at night.
- My best time for meetings is in the early afternoon.
- My energy flags around 4pm and I'll try to take an exercise / sun break.
- Depending on my workout schedule, I'll wrap up my work for the day either pre-dinner or in the late evening (~10pm).

### Meetings

- I try to schedule all my meetings in a single block (aka the [Clockwise](https://www.getclockwise.com/) method).
- I try to keep all my meetings on a single day (or two). At Zapier, I tried to only take meetings on Wed & Thurs.
- I'm willing to take meetings any time during my working hours. When possible, I prefer meetings in the afternoon (see [hours](#hours)).
- I'm also happy to sit and synchronously Slack with you about a topic - that can sometimes be preferred if we're trading a lot of links
- I can take meetings up to 1 hour before my normal start time (typically 9am) if it's an important meeting. I have trouble getting up earlier than that and my energy level will be shot the rest of the day.

## Strengths

- I know a little bit about a lot of topics.
- Because of [how I use Slack](#slack), I have a lot of context of the state of the company.
- A lot of my daily energy goes towards making the people and teams around me more effective.
- I'm good at writing code interfaces and understanding how consumers will want to use our code.
- I enjoy documenting code and processes.
- I'm good at breaking down problems.
- Pub trivia. Mostly because of the aforementioned breadth of knowledge.

## Weaknesses

- I tend to program "by feel". If a test reports an off-by-one error, I'll tweak a line and re-run the tests. If that works, great! If it doesn't... I'll try, try again. If that doesn't clear it up, I'll actually read the code and make the correct fix.
- I'm quick to suggest re-writing existing code, especially if I don't understand it well or think I can modernize it. As my manager/PM, you'll probably need to talk me down from this occasionally.
- Because I spend so much time on Slack helping others, my raw code output is often less than that of my peers. This is usually a net win for the team, but is something to take into consideration if we need a lot of code written quickly.
- I'm optimistic - this serves me well in life, but poorly when estimating how long projects will take.
- I'm a horrible speller. These days, computers usually cover for me, but they can only get you so far.
- I sometimes get compulsively distracted by Reddit/Masto/Slack and get stuck in a loop. Taking a computer break usually fixes it.

## Outside of Work

- You can find me on most sites as `@xavdid`.
- I'm mostly a homebody, although I have traveled a lot. I [road-tripped cross-country in a van](https://www.instagram.com/serenitythevan/) for six months with my then-fianc√©e; ask me about `#vanlife`!
- At home, my major hobbies are:
  - video games (favorite genres: puzzle, adventure, narrative, co-op)
  - tinkering/programming (either on something novel or something useful, but rarely both)
  - board games, especially with friends
  - [blogging](/blog), occasionally
- I've always had an interest in alternative computer input methods. To wit:
  - I use an [Ergodox-EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) as my main keyboard for programming and PC gaming. I love how customizable it is. You can see my full layout (including an interactive tour) [here](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/LMnJ6/latest/0).
  - I've got a [Steam controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Controller) for similar reasons.

Anyway, enough about me. What's next?
