Once I started tracking media in earnest, I found myself in need of a consistent way to rate what I had watched and played. There are a lot of different ways to rate something, such a 10 star scale, a score out out of five, or a simple thumbs up/down.

My biggest gripe is that none of the scores _really_ mean anything; they're good for comparing everything someone has scored, but they each have their problems. A 10 star scale is too wide; what sets a 6 star movie apart from a 7 star movie? The yes/no is informative but has the opposite problem: it doesn't allow for any striation between good and great. A score out of 5 is closer, but it begets my worst enemy: _apathy_. I'm ultimately making these lists to help steer the reader towards the good stuff. If I'm neutral on something, it doesn't provide a definitive signal. Ultimately, none of these scales provided what I needed.

The core information I wanted to impart via a glance at a score was "Do I recommend this media to others?". The system needed to account also needed to account for good vs great without having too many levels. I also wanted to avoid any system that would let me pick a neutral rating (like 3 stars out of 5). I've always struggled with indecision, so taking inspiration from [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/), a "I think it was good but I didn't love it" was a "no". That approach helped guide me: lack of signal was a bad signal.

With this in mind, I arrived a my definitive **4 Point Rating System**. It's important note that this scale measures _how much I enjoyed the media_, not how objectively good it is. Honestly, media is so subjective and personal that I'm not sure such a measure could exist.

- A **4** (aka "Yes!") is the highest rating. It's given to media that excels in multiple areas and has no huge flaws. It's probably not perfect, but it's something I recommend emphatically. Examples include _Get Out_ and _Spirited Away_
- Next is **3** (aka "Yes, but..."). These are still on the top half of the scale, but they have problems. Maybe a good plot with lackluster characters or serious plot holes saved by good characters. Still enjoyable and recommended overall, but doesn't live up to its full potential. Examples include _Doctor Strange_ and _National Treasure_
- **2** (aka "No, but...") is the beginning of the bottom half. Media with this score have more misses than hits, but have their redeeming qualities. Especially if you're a fan of the genre, you might enjoy watching if you can get it for cheap later. Examples include _Now You See Me 2_ and _Thor: The Dark World_
- Lastly, **1** (aka "No!") is an example of something that fails to execute on any level. What good there might be is drowned in a sea of something truly unenjoyable. This is a surprisingly tough score to earn because you _really_ have to drop the ball. Examples include _Transformers 4_ and _A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding_

There you have it! Now whenever you see something I've rated, you'll know at a glance how much I enjoyed it and whether I would recommend it to you. Though all my example here were movies, I use the same system for [books](https://david.reviews/books/), [TV](https://airtable.com/shrCR6Pl3KdNZ1Xru), and [games](https://david.reviews/games/) as well. All the scores are subjective, but hopefully we agree enough that you find them helpful as well.

Happy watching!
